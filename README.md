# DataStructs
[DataStructs.com](https://datastructs.com/) is a platform for interactive visualizations of data structures and algorithms to replace existing sites that offer little in the way of explaining how data structures and algorithms work or why we use them. 

Each page provides straight-forward explanations and a powerful UI for manipulating data structures without writing a single line of code.

As of July 2020, DataStructs is still under development. We're expecting to fully launch by Fall 2020!

## The Stack
DataStructs is built on `React` and `Node.js`, animated with [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) & [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), and continuosly deployed via Netlify.
