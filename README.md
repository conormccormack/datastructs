# DataStructs
[DataStructs.com](https://datastructs.com/) is a platform for interactive visualizations of data structures and algorithms to replace existing sites that offer little in the way of explaining how data structures and algorithms work or why we use them. 

Each page provides straight-forward explanations a powerful UI for manipulating data structures without writing a single line of code.

## The Stack
DataStructs is built on `React` and `Node.js`, animated with [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) & [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), and continuosly deployed via Netlify.
